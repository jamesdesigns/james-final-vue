## Required Documents
This is all the requirements for the Final Vue Project.
It is a simple app that helps you build a team based on members who sign up and login to the application. You will find everything that was included to make this app.

### Conditional logic and array methods render large lists

### Code encapsulated as single-file components

### Code created and managed with real development tools
This entire application has been created and managed with real development tools such as, Vuetify, axios, vuelidate, vuex, and more. 

### Properly used Git with 4 days of commits per week
All my activity can be seen on my main GitHub account.

### Component communication

### User input form with validation
For User Input with form validation, I used this for the Login Page of the applicaiton.
The v-model was used to output the form as the user fills it out. You can find all the necessary code that relates to the form on the following link.

### Custom directive developed and used
Custom directives are used to create the bottom footer on each page of this application. 
You can find the custom directive in the main.js file on line 13-30

### Animation(s) and Transition(s) used
Used the Animate.css for all the page titles on each page. The animation is called bounceIn.

The Transition is implemented in the Header.vue. You can see this following code here:

### App connects to a server using HTTP
This app is connecting to the UInames.com api. You can find this on the Members.vue

### At least 3 routes provided
In this application I have used 4 routes. Home, Members, About, and Login.
This involves the file router.js.

Setting up the 4 routes also resides in the Header.vue, where it sets up the menu navigation

### State managed using Vuex
For this task, I set up the login form to output the Username/Game Experience Level to show up in the footer. You can see this on each page of the application on the bottom of the browser.
